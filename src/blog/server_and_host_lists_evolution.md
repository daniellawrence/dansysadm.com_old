# server and host lists evolution

Every place that I have worked at has had a centralized list of all the servers that they look after ( well all they know of ).

These lists have taken many on many forms and there might be something in the __age/matueatlty__ of the organizations hosting environment.


In our heads
------------

The first place that I worked at was using the "In our heads" method of listing the servers. 
There was only 2 so it was very easy to memorize. Then even had nice English names, so that made it even easier.
The was no point at adding any more complexity to the listing system, as any new staff memory would simply be told that the 2 hosts are "bob" and "john" ( Not the read names).

The Excel spreadsheet v0.1
--------------------------

The second place that I had the opportunity to work at had the "Excel spreadsheet" method of listing servers.
However it did extend past just a list of the 50-100 servers that we where looking after to include the hosts specs, serial numbers, etc.
This was rather handy when doing a hardware support call. As we had the '1-stop-shop' for all the hardware service providers questions.

The environment was static, I was there for a fixed term of 6 months we didn't add or remove any systems so updating the list and keeping to date was not an issue.
Also from the static environment there was never any conflict information of the versions of spread sheets. The only conflict was the spreadsheet vs __realife/relativity__ 

All and all it worked pretty well, the size of the environment and the static nature helped in this case.


The Excelt spreadsheet v1.459
------------------------------

The 3 environment that I was exposed used the same style "Excel spreadsheet" to keep track of all things server.
The interesting part here was that it was for 2,000+ servers.
It was an environment that although never decommissioned hosts, it was always seaming to add them.
