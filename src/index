# welcome

This is my new site that is all written in markdown, then using python it generates html!

I am a UNIX and Linux Systems enthusiast specialising with
automation of Sun/Oracle Solaris and Redhat Linux administration.

I'm passionate about what I do, using the latest technologies and
techniques to deliver the very best solution that I can be proud of.
